## Project Title: An Analysis of Delhi NCR Air Pollution Data Using Remote Sensing

## Research Questions:

1. How has air pollution in Delhi NCR been affected by changing environmental conditions over the past decade?

2. What are the sources of air pollution in Delhi NCR, and how have these sources changed over time?

3. How have the changes in air pollution in Delhi NCR affected public health?

4. What are the most effective strategies for reducing air pollution in Delhi NCR?

## Project Summary:

The aim of this project is to use remote sensing technology to analyze air pollution data from Delhi NCR over the last decade. We will use satellite imagery, air quality measurements, and other sources of data to determine how air pollution has changed over time, the sources of air pollution, and the effects of air pollution on public health. We will also analyze possible strategies for reducing air pollution in Delhi NCR. The results of this research will provide valuable insight into the air pollution problem in Delhi NCR and help inform policy decisions regarding air pollution reduction.

## Research Methodology : 

We will use remote sensing technology to analyze air pollution data from Delhi NCR. This will include the use of satellite imagery, air quality measurements, and other sources of data. We will use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to analyze the spatial variation of air pollution and create detailed maps of air pollution levels in Delhi NCR. We will also use statistical methods to analyze the temporal variation of air pollution levels and identify potential sources of air pollution. We will also use epidemiological methods to analyze the effects of air pollution on public health. Finally, we will analyze potential strategies for reducing air pollution in Delhi NCR.


We will also analyze existing literature on air pollution in Delhi NCR to identify the sources of air pollution, the effects of air pollution on public health, and possible strategies for reducing air pollution.

## Data Sources:

We will use satellite imagery, air quality measurements, and other sources of data to analyze air pollution in Delhi NCR. These data sources will include:

• Satellite imagery, such as MODIS and Landsat, to measure air quality,

• Air quality measurements from the Central Pollution Control Board,

• Meteorological data from the India Meteorological Department,

• Other sources of data, such as traffic counts and emissions inventories.

- We will use satellite imagery from NASA’s Landsat and MODIS programs to analyze the spatial variation of air pollution in Delhi NCR. We will also use air quality measurements from the Central Pollution Control Board of India to analyze the temporal variation of air pollution in Delhi NCR. Finally, we will use other sources of data, such as meteorological data, to identify possible sources of air pollution in Delhi NCR.


## Expected Results:

We expect that our research will provide valuable insight into air pollution in Delhi NCR over the past decade. We anticipate that our results will identify the sources of air pollution, the effects of air pollution on public health, and possible strategies for reducing air pollution in Delhi NCR.


## Conclusion:

This project will use remote sensing technology to analyze air pollution data from Delhi NCR over the last decade. We anticipate that our research will provide valuable insight into the air pollution problem in Delhi NCR and help inform policy decisions regarding air pollution reduction.
